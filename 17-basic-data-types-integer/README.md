Module 17 — Basic Data Types: Integer (int)

Integers are one of the most fundamental data types in Python.
They represent whole numbers (positive, negative, or zero) and are used in almost every program: loops, counters, conditions, ranges, indexes, arithmetic, timers, math formulas, and more.

Although integers seem simple, Python’s int type is extremely powerful and has important behaviors that developers must understand — including unlimited precision, type conversion, arithmetic operators, bitwise operations, and performance considerations.

This module explores integers in depth and prepares you to write clean, efficient, mathematically correct Python code.

What I Will Learn in This Module

By completing this module, I will be able to:

Understand what an integer is in Python

Create integers using different input forms

Perform all arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, //, %, **)

Convert values to integers using int()

Work with binary, octal, and hexadecimal integer forms

Understand Python’s unlimited-precision integer model

Use bitwise operators (AND, OR, XOR, shifts)

Avoid common mistakes when handling numeric data
