Module 7 — Sets

Sets are an incredibly useful data structure in Python.
They store unique, unordered items and allow fast membership checks and powerful set operations similar to mathematics.

In this module, I will learn:

How sets work

When to use sets instead of lists

How to perform union, intersection, difference

How to remove duplicates

How to build professional code using sets efficiently

In this module I will:

Create sets from scratch

Convert lists to sets

Add, remove, and update elements

Use set operations:

union

intersection

difference

symmetric difference

Understand when sets are the BEST tool for the job

Solve tasks from Rank 1 to Rank 5
