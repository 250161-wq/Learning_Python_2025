Module 12 — Conditionals (if, elif, else)

This module introduces one of the core elements of programming: making decisions with conditional statements.
Conditionals allow a program to choose what to do based on values, comparisons, and logical expressions. Every real application uses them, from simple scripts to complex systems.

By the end of this module, I will be able to write clear, correct, and professional conditional logic using if, elif, and else.

What I Will Learn in This Module

How if, elif, and else work and when to use each one

How to write conditions that compare numbers, strings, and variables

How logical operators work (and, or, not)

How to nest conditionals responsibly

How to avoid common mistakes such as unreachable code

How to design clean, readable decision-making structures

How conditionals appear in real applications
