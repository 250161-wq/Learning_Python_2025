# ============================================================
# Rank 1 — Beginner
# Simple one-condition tasks to get comfortable with `if`.
# ============================================================

# Task 1.1
# Write an if statement that prints "Positive" only if the
# variable number is greater than 0.
#
# number = 5
#
# Write your code below:


# Task 1.2
# Given:
#   password = "python123"
# Write an if/else block that prints "Access granted" if the
# password matches and "Access denied" otherwise.
#
# Write your code below:


# Task 1.3
# Write an if/else that checks a variable age.
# If age is 18 or more, print "Adult". Otherwise print "Minor".
#
# Write your code below:


# ============================================================
# Rank 2 — Easy
# Multiple branches with elif.
# ============================================================

# Task 2.1
# Create a grading system:
# If score >= 90 → "A"
# If score >= 80 → "B"
# If score >= 70 → "C"
# Else → "D or below"
#
# Write your code below:


# Task 2.2
# Use elif to check temperature:
# < 0       → "Freezing"
# < 10      → "Very cold"
# < 20      → "Cold"
# else      → "Warm"
#
# Write your code below:


# Task 2.3
# Ask the user for a color (input) and print a message:
# - "Primary color" if the color is red, blue, or yellow
# - "Secondary color" if the color is green, purple, or orange
# - Otherwise "Unknown color"
#
# Write your code below:


# ============================================================
# Rank 3 — Intermediate
# Combining multiple logical conditions.
# ============================================================

# Task 3.1
# Write a condition that checks:
# age >= 18 AND user_is_member == True
# If both are true, print "Entry allowed". Otherwise print "Blocked".
#
# Write your code below:


# Task 3.2
# A number is valid if:
# - it is positive AND
# - it is NOT equal to 10
#
# Write code that prints "Valid" or "Invalid".
#
# Write your code below:


# Task 3.3
# Write a login check using AND:
# username == "admin"
# password == "1234"
#
# If both match → print "Login successful"
# else → print "Invalid credentials"
#
# Write your code below:


# ============================================================
# Rank 4 — Advanced
# Nested conditionals and structured decision-making.
# ============================================================

# Task 4.1
# Using nested conditionals:
# If user_role is "admin":
#     If account_active is True:
#         print "Admin panel opened"
#     Else:
#         print "Account inactive"
# Else:
#     print "Standard user"
#
# Write your code below:


# Task 4.2
# Create input validation logic:
# Ask the user to enter a number.
# - If the number is negative → print "Error: negative"
# - If the number is zero → print "Zero"
# - If the number is positive → print "Positive number"
#
# Write your code below:


# Task 4.3
# A store gives discounts:
# - If purchase >= 100 → discount = 20
# - Else if purchase >= 50 → discount = 10
# - Else → discount = 0
#
# Additionally:
# - If customer_is_vip is True → add +5 to the discount
#
# Print the final discount.
#
# Write your code below:


# ============================================================
# Rank 5 — Professional
# More realistic conditional workflows.
# ============================================================

# Task 5.1
# Write a decision system for shipping costs:
# - If weight < 1 kg → cost = 5
# - If weight < 5 kg → cost = 10
# - If weight < 20 kg → cost = 20
# - Else → cost = 50
#
# If express_shipping is True, add +15 to the final price.
#
# Print the final cost.
#
# Write your code below:


# Task 5.2
# Write logic for student status:
# - If grade >= 70 and attendance >= 80 → "Pass"
# - If grade >= 70 and attendance < 80 → "Fail due to attendance"
# - If grade < 70 and attendance >= 80 → "Fail due to grade"
# - Otherwise → "Fail"
#
# Write your code below:


# Task 5.3
# Build a small menu system:
# menu_choice = 1 → print "Start"
# menu_choice = 2 → print "Settings"
# menu_choice = 3 → print "Exit"
# any other value → print "Invalid option"
#
# Use if/elif/else.
#
# Write your code below:
