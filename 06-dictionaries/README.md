Module 6 — Dictionaries

Dictionaries are one of the most powerful and flexible data structures in Python.
They allow me to store data as key-value pairs, making them perfect for:

Settings & configurations

User profiles

Count maps

Fast lookups

Data modeling

JSON-like structures

This module gives me a solid professional foundation in dictionary usage.

In this module I will:

Understand how dictionaries store and retrieve data

Learn how to:

Add, update, and delete keys

Loop through keys, values, and items

Use safe access (dict.get)

Merge dictionaries

Work with nested dictionaries

Use dictionary comprehensions

Solve tasks from Rank 1 to Rank 5, growing from beginner to production-level patterns
