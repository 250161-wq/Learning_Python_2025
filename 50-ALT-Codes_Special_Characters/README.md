# Module 50 — ALT Codes (Special Characters)

Author: Peyman Miyandashti  
Year: 2025  

In this module, I learn how **ALT codes** work in Windows and how special
characters can be printed and used in Python programs.

ALT codes allow me to type characters that are not easily accessible
on the keyboard, such as box-drawing characters, arrows, math symbols,
currency symbols, and special letters.

These characters are especially useful for:
- console user interfaces
- ASCII / text-based layouts
- terminal dashboards
- menus and separators
- educational tools and visual output

By the end of this module, I should feel comfortable:
- understanding what ALT codes are
- knowing when ALT codes work (Windows + numeric keypad)
- printing special characters in Python
- organizing characters by category
- using them in clean, readable console output
