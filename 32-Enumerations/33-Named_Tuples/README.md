Module 33 — Named Tuples

Author: Peyman Miyandashti
Year: 2025

In this module, I learn how named tuples work in Python.

Named tuples are a lightweight way to create immutable objects with named fields.
They combine the simplicity and performance of tuples with the readability of objects.

Instead of accessing values by index, I can access them by meaningful names.
This makes code easier to read, safer to maintain, and closer to real data models.

Named tuples are commonly used for:

simple data records

returning structured data from functions

replacing small classes

representing rows of data

improving code clarity without extra overhead

By the end of this module, I should feel comfortable:

Understanding what a named tuple is

Creating named tuples using collections.namedtuple

Accessing fields by name and index

Knowing when to use named tuples instead of tuples or classes

Understanding immutability

Using named tuples in real-world scenarios

This module helps bridge the gap between basic data structures and full custom classes.

Key Learning Objectives

By completing this module, I will be able to:

Explain the purpose of named tuples

Create named tuples

Access data clearly using field names

Understand immutability rules

Compare named tuples, tuples, and classes

Write cleaner and more expressive code
