Module 32 — Enumerations

Author: Peyman Miyandashti
Year: 2025

In this module, I learn how enumerations (Enum) work in Python.

Enumerations allow me to define a fixed set of named values.
Instead of using magic numbers or hard-coded strings, I can give meaning and structure to constant values.

Enums make code easier to read, safer to maintain, and harder to misuse.
They are commonly used for things like states, statuses, categories, modes, and configuration options.

By the end of this module, I should feel comfortable:

Understanding what an enumeration is

Knowing when to use enums instead of constants

Creating enums using the enum module

Accessing enum members and values

Comparing enum members safely

Using enums in real-world scenarios

This module helps me write clearer and more maintainable Python code.

Key Learning Objectives

By completing this module, I will be able to:

Explain the purpose of enumerations

Create enums using Enum

Access enum names and values

Compare enum members correctly

Use enums in conditions and logic

Avoid common mistakes with constants

Exercise Difficulty Framework (Ranking System)

Rank 1 — Beginner
Basic enum creation and access.

Rank 2 — Easy
Using enums in conditions.

Rank 3 — Intermediate
Enums with custom values and logic.

Rank 4 — Advanced
IntEnum, auto values, and comparisons.

Recommended Study Workflow

Start with Enumerations_Notes.py to understand the concept clearly.
Run and modify Enumerations_Examples.py to see enums in action.
Complete Enumerations_Tasks.py before checking solutions.
Review Enumerations_Tasks_Solutions.py to adopt clean patterns.

Enums help replace fragile constants with strong, meaningful code.
