Module 1 — Variables & Data Types

This module introduces the foundations of Python.
Here I learn how Python stores information, how variables work, and how different data types behave when I use them in real code.

In this module I work on:

Understanding what a variable is and how to create one.

Learning how to store numbers, text, and logical values.

Practicing the most common Python data types:

int — whole numbers

float — decimal numbers

str — text

bool — True/False

Collections: list, tuple, dict, set

Writing clear, readable code with good naming practices.

Solving exercises that gradually increase in difficulty, from beginner to more realistic and professional-style examples.

Files included in this module

Variables_Notes.py
Detailed explanations of each concept with short, simple examples.

Variables_Examples.py
Practical examples that show how variables and data types are used in everyday Python code.

Variables_Tasks.py
A collection of exercises for me to solve on my own.

Variables_Tasks_Solutions.py
Clean, well-written solutions that I can compare against my work to improve my coding style.

Difficulty Levels (Ranking System)

The exercises are organized into levels to help me progress step by step:

Rank 1 – Beginner
Very simple exercises to get started.

Rank 2 – Easy
Slightly more combined ideas, but still straightforward.

Rank 3 – Intermediate
Longer problems that require more reasoning.

Rank 4 – Advanced
Exercises similar to what I might find in real projects.

Rank 5 – Professional
More polished and structured code, written in a production-style way.

I can move through the ranks at my own pace — no need to complete everything in one session.

How to study this module

Recommended order:

Read Variables_Notes.py

Run and explore Variables_Examples.py

Solve the tasks in Variables_Tasks.py

Review and compare with Variables_Tasks_Solutions.py

Once I feel confident with everything here, I move on to:
