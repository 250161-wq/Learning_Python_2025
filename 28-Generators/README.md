Module 28 — Generators

Author: Peyman Miyandashti
Year: 2025

In this module, I learn how generators work in Python.

Generators are a powerful feature that allow a program to produce values one at a time instead of all at once.
They are designed to improve memory usage and make programs more efficient, especially when working with large datasets or continuous streams of data.

Unlike lists, generators do not store all values in memory.
They generate values only when needed, using the yield keyword.

This way of working changes how I think about data and iteration.
Instead of asking, “How do I store everything?”, I start asking, “How do I process values as they come?”.

By the end of this module, I should feel completely comfortable:

Understanding what generators are and why they exist

Writing generator functions using yield

Iterating safely over generators

Using next() correctly

Knowing the difference between generators and lists

Using generators for large or infinite sequences

This module prepares me for more advanced topics such as data pipelines, streaming data, file processing, and performance-focused programming.

Key Learning Objectives

By completing this module, I will be able to:

Explain lazy evaluation in Python
