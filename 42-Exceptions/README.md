Module 42 — Exceptions

Author: Peyman Miyandashti
Year: 2025

In this module, I learn how exceptions work in Python.

Exceptions are Python’s way of handling errors safely and intentionally.
Instead of crashing programs or hiding problems, exceptions allow me to detect errors, react to them, and keep programs stable.

Exceptions are essential for:

input validation

file handling

API and network calls

user-facing applications

writing robust, production-ready code

By the end of this module, I should feel comfortable:

Understanding what exceptions are

Using try, except, else, and finally

Catching specific exception types

Raising custom exceptions

Writing safe and readable error-handling logic

This module is fundamental for real-world Python programming.

Key Learning Objectives

By completing this module, I will be able to:

Explain how Python handles runtime errors

Catch and handle exceptions safely

Distinguish between different exception types

Use else and finally correctly

Raise exceptions intentionally

Design clean and predictable error flows

Recommended Study Workflow

Start with Exceptions_Notes.py to understand exception mechanics clearly.
Run and modify Exceptions_Examples.py to observe behavior.
Complete Exceptions_Tasks.py before checking solutions.
Review Exceptions_Tasks_Solutions.py to adopt professional patterns.

Exceptions are not about avoiding errors — they are about handling them well.
