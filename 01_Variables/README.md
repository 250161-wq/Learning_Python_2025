# Module 01: Python Variables

Welcome to the first module of **Learning_Python_2025**! This module provides a comprehensive introduction to variables in Python.

## 📚 What's Included

This module contains two versions of the same content:

1. **`variables_tutorial.ipynb`** - Interactive Jupyter Notebook (recommended)
2. **`variables_tutorial.py`** - Python script for quick reference

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

- ✅ Understand what variables are and how they work
- ✅ Know the rules for naming variables in Python
- ✅ Follow best practices and naming conventions
- ✅ Work with different data types (int, float, str, bool, list, dict, tuple, set)
- ✅ Perform type conversions
- ✅ Complete hands-on practice exercises
- ✅ Build a mini-project: Personal Information Card

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Option 1: Jupyter Notebook (Interactive)

1. Make sure you have Jupyter installed:
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter
   ```

2. Navigate to this directory:
   ```bash
   cd 01_Variables
   ```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook variables_tutorial.ipynb
   ```

4. Run each cell to learn interactively!

### Option 2: Python Script

1. Navigate to this directory:
   ```bash
   cd 01_Variables
   ```

2. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python variables_tutorial.py
   ```

## 📖 Topics Covered

### 1. What are Variables?
- Introduction to variables
- Basic syntax
- Multiple assignment
- Dynamic typing

### 2. Naming Rules
- Required naming conventions
- Valid vs invalid names
- Case sensitivity
- Python keywords to avoid

### 3. Best Practices
- snake_case convention
- UPPER_CASE for constants
- Descriptive naming
- Code readability tips

### 4. Data Types
- **Numeric Types**: int, float, complex
- **String Type**: str
- **Boolean Type**: bool
- **List Type**: Ordered, mutable collections
- **Tuple Type**: Ordered, immutable collections
- **Dictionary Type**: Key-value pairs
- **Set Type**: Unique elements
- **Type Conversion**: Between different types

### 5. Practice Exercises
Six hands-on exercises with solutions:
1. Basic variable assignment
2. Variable swap
3. Data type identification
4. String manipulation
5. List operations
6. Dictionary creation

### 6. Mini-Project
Build a **Personal Information Card** that demonstrates:
- Using multiple variable types
- Working with lists and dictionaries
- String formatting
- Professional output formatting

## 💡 Tips

- **Start with the Jupyter Notebook** - It's interactive and easier to learn
- **Run each code cell** to see the output
- **Modify the examples** to experiment and learn
- **Complete all exercises** before moving to the next module
- **Customize the mini-project** with your own information
