Module 44 — Ellipsis

Author: Peyman Miyandashti
Year: 2025

In this module, I learn how ellipsis (...) works in Python.

Ellipsis is a built-in singleton object that appears simple, but it has real meaning and use cases in Python, especially in advanced and professional codebases.

Ellipsis is commonly used for:

placeholders for incomplete code

slicing in multi-dimensional data

APIs and interfaces under construction

type hints and static typing

readable stubs and scaffolding

By the end of this module, I should feel comfortable:

Understanding what ... actually is

Knowing when ellipsis is valid Python syntax

Using ellipsis as a placeholder

Using ellipsis in slicing

Recognizing ellipsis in professional code

This module prepares me for reading and writing more advanced Python.

Key Learning Objectives

By completing this module, I will be able to:

Explain what the ellipsis object is

Use ... correctly in code

Replace pass with ellipsis where appropriate

Understand ellipsis in slicing contexts

Read codebases that use ellipsis intentionally
