Module 4 — Working With Files

File handling is one of the most essential skills in Python.
Almost every program needs to read or write data — logs, text files, configuration files, CSV data, user input, reports, etc.

This module provides a strong foundation for using Python’s file operations in a safe, professional way.

Key Learning Objectives

By completing this module, I will be able to:

Open files safely using the open() function.

Read entire files, line-by-line, or in chunks.

Write new data to files or append to existing files.

Understand file modes: "r", "w", "a", "r+", "w+".

Use context managers (with open(...)) to avoid errors and automatic file closing.

Work with file paths using pathlib (professional best practice).

Handle errors such as missing files using try/except.

Process text files, logs, and simple CSV-like data.

Module File Structure

Inside the 04-files folder there will be:

Files_Notes.py
Explanations of reading, writing, appending, context managers, and examples.

Files_Examples.py
Demonstrations of common patterns used in real projects.

Files_Tasks.py
Exercises from beginner to professional level.

Files_Tasks_Solutions.py
Clean, correct, professional solutions.
