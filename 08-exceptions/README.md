Module 8 — Exceptions (Error Handling)

Errors happen in every program — missing files, wrong inputs, invalid operations, and more.
This module teaches me how to prevent crashes, handle problems safely, and write robust, real-world applications.

Python’s exception system allows me to:

Detect errors

Handle them gracefully

Provide clear user feedback

Recover and continue execution

Debug more effectively

In this module I will:

Understand what exceptions are

Learn about:

try

except

else

finally

raise

Handle common exceptions:

ValueError

TypeError

ZeroDivisionError

FileNotFoundError

KeyError

Write custom exception messages

Raise exceptions intentionally

Build professional-style error-handling structures

Practice debugging logic

Solve tasks from Rank 1 → Rank 5
