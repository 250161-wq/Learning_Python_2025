Module 34 — Data Classes

Author: Peyman Miyandashti
Year: 2025

In this module, I learn how data classes work in Python.

Data classes are a modern and powerful way to create classes that are mainly used to store data.
They reduce boilerplate code by automatically generating methods like __init__, __repr__, and __eq__.

Data classes are designed to replace many use cases where I would normally write a class just to hold values.
They make code shorter, clearer, and easier to maintain.

Data classes are commonly used for:

data models

configuration objects

records and entities

structured return values

clean and readable domain models

By the end of this module, I should feel comfortable:

Understanding what a data class is

Creating data classes using @dataclass

Using default values and type hints

Understanding mutability and immutability

Comparing data classes to named tuples and regular classes

Writing clean, professional data models

This module represents a major step toward modern, production-style Python.

Key Learning Objectives

By completing this module, I will be able to:

Explain why data classes exist

Create and use data classes

Use type annotations effectively

Add default values and optional fields

Understand generated methods

Decide when to use data classes vs other structures

Recommended Study Workflow

Start with Data_Classes_Notes.py to understand the concept clearly.
Run and modify Data_Classes_Examples.py to see data classes in action.
Complete Data_Classes_Tasks.py before checking solutions.
Review Data_Classes_Tasks_Solutions.py to adopt clean patterns.
