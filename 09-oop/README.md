Module 9 — Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is one of the most important concepts in Python.
It allows me to structure programs using classes and objects, making code:

More organized

More reusable

Easier to maintain

Easier to expand

More realistic for real-world applications

This module teaches me everything I need to become a true Python developer.

In this module I will learn:
✔ Core OOP concepts

What classes and objects are

Attributes & methods

The __init__ constructor

Instance vs class attributes

How Python stores and resolves attributes

✔ Intermediate concepts

Encapsulation

Private / protected variables

The self keyword

String representation (__str__, __repr__)

✔ Advanced OOP concepts

Inheritance

Multiple inheritance

Method overriding

super()

Polymorphism

Abstract classes (ABC)

Magic / dunder methods

✔ Professional patterns

Data models

Composition vs inheritance

Factory methods

Clean OOP design principles
