Module 13 — Ranges

This module explains how Python’s range() object works and how it is used in iteration, indexing, loops, and generating numeric sequences.
The range() function is one of the most frequently used tools in Python, especially when working with loops, mathematics, and controlled iteration patterns.

By the end of this module, I will understand how to create ranges, how they behave internally, and how to use them effectively in real code.

What I Will Learn in This Module

What a range object is and how it differs from a list

How range(start, stop, step) works

How to loop over ranges in professional code

How negative steps work and how to reverse sequences

How to convert ranges into lists when needed

Common mistakes (such as off-by-one errors) and how to avoid them

Performance differences between range objects and lists

Module File Structure

Ranges_Notes.py
Detailed explanations of range objects, memory behavior, parameters, examples, and best practices.

Ranges_Examples.py
A set of clear, hands-on examples showing common real-world uses of ranges.

Ranges_Tasks.py
Exercises designed to practice constructing and using ranges in different scenarios.

Ranges_Tasks_Solutions.py
Clean, correct reference solutions.
(Should be checked only after attempting the tasks.)

Difficulty Levels in This Module

Rank 1 — Beginner
Basic uses of range with one or two arguments.

Rank 2 — Easy
Using three arguments (start, stop, step) and simple patterns.

Rank 3 — Intermediate
Ranges in loops, reversed ranges, and index-based iteration.

Rank 4 — Advanced
Working with large ranges, slicing logic, and performance considerations.

Rank 5 — Professional
Real-world patterns for data processing, batching, pagination, and iteration control.

Recommended Study Workflow

Begin by reading the explanations in Ranges_Notes.py.

Run and observe the behavior of the code in Ranges_Examples.py.

Practice building and using ranges in Ranges_Tasks.py.

Compare your work with Ranges_Tasks_Solutions.py.

Apply the knowledge to loops, indexing, and list processing in future modules.

Next Steps

After mastering this module, you will be able to use ranges confidently with loops, slices, and mathematical patterns in Python.
