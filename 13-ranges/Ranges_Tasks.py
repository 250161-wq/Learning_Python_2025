Practice Tasks

This file contains structured exercises to help practice creating and using
Python range objects in real situations. Work from Rank 1 to Rank 5.
Only open the solutions file after attempting each problem honestly.
"""

# ============================================================
# Rank 1 — Beginner
# Simple use of range() with one or two arguments.
# ============================================================

# Task 1.1
# Create a range that produces numbers 0–4 and print them using list().
#
# Write your code below:


# Task 1.2
# Create a range from 3 to 7 (inclusive of 3, exclusive of 7),
# then print each value in a loop.
#
# Write your code below:


# Task 1.3
# Use range() to print numbers 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.
#
# Write your code below:


# ============================================================
# Rank 2 — Easy
# Introduce step values and simple patterns.
# ============================================================

# Task 2.1
# Use range() to print all even numbers from 0 to 20.
#
# Write your code below:


# Task 2.2
# Create a range that prints: 5, 8, 11, 14, 17
# (hint: step = 3)
#
# Write your code below:


# Task 2.3
# Use range() to print numbers backwards from 10 to 1.
#
# Write your code below:


# ============================================================
# Rank 3 — Intermediate
# Combined ranges, indexes, and logic in loops.
# ============================================================

# Task 3.1
# Using a loop and range(), print:
# Index 0 → Ana
# Index 1 → Luis
# Index 2 → Pablo
#
# names = ["Ana", "Luis", "Pablo"]
#
# Write your code below:


# Task 3.2
# Create a list of numbers from 1 to 20.
# Using a range-based loop, print only the numbers at even indexes.
#
# Example indexes: 0, 2, 4, 6, ...
#
# Write your code below:


# Task 3.3
# Create a reversed list of numbers from 1 to 10 using range().
# Then print the resulting list.
#
# Write your code below:


# ============================================================
# Rank 4 — Advanced
# Larger ranges, slicing behavior, and batching.
# ============================================================

# Task 4.1
# Using range(), process the following list in batches of size 4:
# data = list(range(1, 17))
#
# Output should look like:
# Batch: [1, 2, 3, 4]
# Batch: [5, 6, 7, 8]
# ...
#
# Write your code below:


# Task 4.2
# Create a range of numbers from 50 down to 0 in steps of -5.
# Print the entire sequence as a list.
#
# Write your code below:


# Task 4.3
# Check using the "in" operator whether 75 and 200 are inside range(0, 101).
# Print True or False for each.
#
# Write your code below:


# ============================================================
# Rank 5 — Professional
# Realistic patterns used in data processing and algorithms.
# ============================================================

# Task 5.1
# Build a pagination simulator.
#
# data = list(range(1, 51))   # 50 items
# page_size = 10
#
# Use range() to determine page starts (0, 10, 20, 30, 40)
# Print each page as:
# Page 1: [...]
# Page 2: [...]
# etc.
#
# Write your code below:


# Task 5.2
# Generate all multiples of 7 from 0 to 500 using range().
# Print the result as a list.
#
# Write your code below:


# Task 5.3
# Using range(), simulate a countdown timer.
# For example: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, "Lift off!"
#
# Write your code below:
