Module 37 — Lambda Functions

Author: Peyman Miyandashti
Year: 2025

In this module, I learn how lambda functions work in Python.

Lambda functions are small, anonymous functions written in a single line.
They are useful when I need simple behavior without defining a full function using def.

Lambdas are commonly used with functions like:

map()

filter()

sorted()

min() / max()

key functions

They help make code more compact, but they should be used carefully to keep readability.

By the end of this module, I should feel comfortable:

Understanding what a lambda function is

Writing lambda functions correctly

Knowing when lambdas are appropriate

Using lambdas with built-in functions

Comparing lambdas to regular functions

Writing clean, readable functional-style code

This module improves my ability to write expressive and concise Python.

Key Learning Objectives

By completing this module, I will be able to:

Explain lambda function syntax

Use lambda expressions as inline functions

Replace small def functions with lambdas

Use lambdas with map, filter, and sorted

Avoid overusing lambdas in complex logic

Recommended Study Workflow

Start with Lambda_Functions_Notes.py to understand lambda functions clearly.
Run and modify Lambda_Functions_Examples.py to see lambdas in action.
Complete Lambda_Functions_Tasks.py before checking solutions.
Review Lambda_Functions_Tasks_Solutions.py to adopt clean patterns.

Lambda functions are powerful when used with intention and restraint.
