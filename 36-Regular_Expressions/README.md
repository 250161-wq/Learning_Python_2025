Module 36 — Regular Expressions

Author: Peyman Miyandashti
Year: 2025

In this module, I learn how regular expressions work in Python.

Regular expressions (regex) are a powerful way to search, match, extract, and transform text.
They allow me to describe patterns instead of writing long manual string logic.

Regex is commonly used for:

validating input (emails, passwords, IDs)

searching text

extracting structured data

cleaning and transforming strings

log processing

parsing files

At first, regular expressions may look difficult, but they become very clear when broken down step by step.

By the end of this module, I should feel comfortable:

Understanding what regular expressions are

Using Python’s re module

Matching patterns in text

Extracting data with groups

Replacing text using patterns

Writing readable and maintainable regex

This module is essential for real-world text processing and data preparation.

Key Learning Objectives

By completing this module, I will be able to:

Explain what regular expressions are

Use re.search, re.match, and re.findall

Work with character classes and quantifiers

Use groups and capture data

Replace text using re.sub

Validate common string formats

Exercise Difficulty Framework (Ranking System)

Rank 1 — Beginner
Basic matching and searching.

Rank 2 — Easy
Character classes and repetition.

Rank 3 — Intermediate
Groups and data extraction.

Recommended Study Workflow

Start with Regular_Expressions_Notes.py to understand regex concepts clearly.
Run and modify Regular_Expressions_Examples.py to see patterns in action.
Complete Regular_Expressions_Tasks.py before checking solutions.
Review Regular_Expressions_Tasks_Solutions.py to adopt clean patterns.

Regular expressions turn text problems into pattern problems.
