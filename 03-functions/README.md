Module 3 — Functions

Functions are one of the most important building blocks in Python. They allow you to organize logic, reuse code, and build larger, more maintainable programs.
This module builds a strong foundation by moving from simple function definitions to more advanced, professional-grade patterns.

In this module I will:

Understand what functions are and why they matter.

Learn how to define and call functions.

Work with:

Positional parameters

Keyword parameters

Default values

Return statements

Write clean, reusable function logic.

Practice problems from Beginner (Rank 1) to Professional (Rank 5).

Ranking System (Difficulty Levels)

Rank 1 → Beginner:
Very simple, one-step function usage.

Rank 2 → Easy:
Slightly more logic inside each function.

Rank 3 → Intermediate:
Multiple steps, calculations, or small workflows.

Rank 4 → Advanced:
More realistic tasks resembling real-world programming.

Rank 5 → Professional:
Clean, industry-style functions with best practices.
