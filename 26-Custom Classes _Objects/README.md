Module 26 — Custom Classes & Objects

Author: Peyman Miyandashti
Year: 2025

In this module, I learn how to create my own custom classes and objects.
This is the beginning of true object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python.

Classes allow me to model real-world concepts — such as Students, Cars, Users, Products, Animals, Bank Accounts, and more — by grouping data (attributes) and behavior (methods) into reusable structures.

Objects created from a class can hold different values, but all share the same blueprint.
Learning how to design and work with classes is one of the most important skills in Python, especially for:

Application development

Data modeling

APIs and backend development

Automation

Games and simulations

Larger, scalable software projects

By the end of this module, I should feel confident creating classes, defining attributes, writing methods, instantiating objects, and representing real-world entities in clean, reusable Python code.

Key Learning Objectives

By completing this module, I will be able to:

🔹 Understand what a class is

A blueprint for creating objects.

🔹 Understand what an object is

A concrete instance created from a class, with its own data.

🔹 Use the __init__ constructor

Initialize attributes at the moment the object is created.

🔹 Define and use instance methods

Methods that work with an object's data through self.

🔹 Add custom behavior to objects

Make classes realistic and functional.

🔹 Use special methods (__str__, __repr__)

Give objects professional, readable representations.

🔹 Modify attributes and call methods on instances

Interact with objects in natural, Pythonic ways.
