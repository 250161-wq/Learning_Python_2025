Module 2 — Loops (Iteration)

This module introduces Python’s core iteration mechanisms: for loops, while loops, and controlled repetition patterns used throughout real-world software development.
Mastering loops is essential for processing data, automating repetitive tasks, and structuring logical flow within programs.

Key Learning Objectives

By completing this module, I will be able to:

Understand the purpose and mechanics of iterative control structures.

Use for loops to iterate over sequences, ranges, and iterable objects.

Use while loops to perform repetition based on dynamic conditions.

Identify when to use each loop type effectively.

Apply break, continue, and else clauses in loop constructs.

Write loops that are clean, readable, and optimized for clarity and correctness.

Recognize and avoid common logical errors such as infinite loops.

Module File Structure

Exercise Difficulty Framework (Ranking System)

Rank 1 – Beginner
Basic loop syntax and simple repetitions.

Rank 2 – Easy
Iterating over simple collections and ranges.

Rank 3 – Intermediate
Multi-step iterations requiring careful control flow.

Rank 4 – Advanced
Realistic data-processing patterns and nested loops.

Rank 5 – Professional
Optimized, production-style iterative solutions that emphasize readability and best practices.

Learners may progress through the ranks at their own pace.
