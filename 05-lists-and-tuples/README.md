Module 5 — Lists & Tuples

Lists and tuples are fundamental building blocks of Python.
They allow us to store collections of items, process sequences, transform data, and build more complex structures.

This module builds a strong foundation by exploring how lists and tuples work, how to access and modify them, common operations, slicing, iteration, unpacking, and best practices that real developers use daily.

In this module I will:

Understand what lists and tuples are.

Learn the differences between:

Mutable lists

Immutable tuples

Practice:

Indexing

Slicing

Adding, removing, and modifying items

Iterating through sequences

Searching and counting

Sorting

Conversions between lists and tuples

Work through challenges from Rank 1 to Rank 5.
