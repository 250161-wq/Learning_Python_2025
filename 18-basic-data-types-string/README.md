Module 18 — Basic Data Types: String

This module focuses on Python’s string type: how to create, inspect, modify, and use text in real programs.
Strings are everywhere in software — user input, file content, API responses, error messages, logs, and more.
Getting really comfortable with them is a big step toward writing professional Python code.

What I will learn in this module

By the end of this module, I will be able to:

- Create and use string literals with single, double, and triple quotes.
- Understand that strings are sequences of characters (indexing and slicing).
- Combine strings with concatenation and f-strings.
- Use common string methods (lower, upper, strip, replace, split, join, etc.).
- Work with whitespace and escape characters safely.
- Loop over strings and search for characters or substrings.
- Recognize that strings are immutable and what that means for performance and design.

Module file structure

This module uses the same structure as the previous ones in this repository:

- `String_Notes.py`  
  Conceptual notes about strings, with small inline examples and comments.
  This is the “theory plus mini-examples” file.

- `String_Examples.py`  
  A collection of focused, runnable examples that show how to use strings in
  clean, realistic ways.

- `String_Tasks.py`  
  Practice exercises, organized by difficulty. I’m supposed to write my own
  solutions here before looking at any answers.

- `String_Tasks_Solutions.py`  
  One possible set of solutions for each task, using clear and professional
  Python code. This file is for review and comparison after I’ve tried the
  tasks myself.

Difficulty and ranking system

Like other modules in this project, the tasks and examples are organized
using a simple ranking system:

- Rank 1 — Beginner  
  Very simple string operations: basic printing, length, simple concatenation.

- Rank 2 — Easy  
  Working with indexing, slicing, and a few basic string methods.

- Rank 3 — Intermediate  
  Combining multiple operations (e.g., cleaning and splitting text, building
  small messages, basic validation).

- Rank 4 — Advanced  
  More realistic problems: processing user input, normalizing text,
  searching and counting patterns.

- Rank 5 — Professional  
  Small “real-world style” utilities: building formatted messages, simple
  parsers, and reusable helper functions for strings.

Suggested study workflow

To get the most out of this module, I will:

1. Read through `String_Notes.py` to refresh the core concepts.
2. Run and experiment with `String_Examples.py`, changing values and observing
   how the output changes.
3. Work through all tasks in `String_Tasks.py`, from Rank 1 up to Rank 5,
   without opening the solutions.
4. Only after I’ve made a serious attempt, open `String_Tasks_Solutions.py`
   and compare my approach with the provided one:
   - If my solution works but looks different, that’s okay.
   - If my code is harder to read, I can refactor it using ideas from the solutions.

What comes next

After this module, I will have covered both:

- Integers (Module 17 — Basic Data Types: Integer)
- Strings (Module 18 — Basic Data Types: String)

Together, these form the foundation for most beginner and intermediate Python
programs. From here, I can comfortably move on to more complex topics such as
collections, file handling, and working with external data.
