# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Rank 1 — Beginner-Advanced
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Task 1
# Create a simple mixin called PrintMixin
# with a method print_message(self, message).


# Task 2
# Create a class that uses PrintMixin
# and call the mixin method.


# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Rank 2 — Easy
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Task 3
# Create a TimestampMixin that returns a fixed timestamp string.
# Use it in another class.


# Task 4
# Explain (in comments) why the mixin does not need an __init__ method.


# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Rank 3 — Intermediate
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Task 5
# Create two mixins:
# - LoggerMixin
# - SerializerMixin
# Then create a class that uses both.


# Task 6
# Call methods from both mixins
# and verify they work together.


# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Rank 4 — Advanced
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Task 7
# Create two mixins with methods that have the same name.
# Observe which method is called and explain why (MRO).


# Task 8
# Print the __mro__ of the class
# and explain the resolution order in comments.


# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Rank 5 — Professional
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Task 9
# Design a realistic mixin (e.g. ValidationMixin, SaveMixin, AuditMixin)
# that could be reused across multiple business classes.


# Task 10
# Explain (in comments):
# - when mixins are a good design choice
# - when composition is better than mixins


# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Final Notes
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# These tasks reinforce:
# - reusable behavior design
# - safe multiple inheritance
# - professional mixin usage
