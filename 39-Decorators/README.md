Module 39 — Decorators

Author: Peyman Miyandashti
Year: 2025

In this module, I learn how decorators work in Python.

Decorators allow me to modify or extend the behavior of functions and methods without changing their code.
They are a powerful feature based on the idea that functions are first-class objects.

Decorators are commonly used for:

logging

access control

timing execution

validation

caching

instrumentation

Instead of repeating the same logic inside many functions, decorators let me apply that logic once and reuse it everywhere.

By the end of this module, I should feel comfortable:

Understanding what decorators are

Knowing how @decorator syntax works

Writing my own decorators

Using decorators with arguments

Decorating functions and methods

Recognizing real-world decorator patterns

This module is a major step toward professional Python design.

Key Learning Objectives

By completing this module, I will be able to:

Explain how decorators work internally

Use functions as arguments and return values

Apply decorators using @ syntax

Write reusable decorators

Control function behavior cleanly

Read and understand decorator-heavy code
