Module 20 — Basic Data Types: Boolean

Author: Peyman Miyandashti
Year: 2025

Booleans are one of the most important and powerful basic data types in Python.
A boolean can only represent two values: True or False.
Even though it looks simple, the boolean type is the foundation of all logic, conditions, decision making, and program flow in Python.

In this module, I focus on understanding how booleans work, how Python creates them, and how I can use them to make my programs think and behave intelligently.

By the end of this module, I should feel confident using booleans in real code:
from small conditions to more realistic examples involving comparisons, decisions, validations, and control flow.

Key Learning Objectives

By completing this module, I will be able to:

🔹 Understand what a boolean is

Where boolean values come from and why they matter in programming.

🔹 Create boolean variables

Assign True or False knowingly and understand how Python evaluates expressions.

🔹 Use booleans in expressions

Work with comparison operators and logical operators (and, or, not).

🔹 Write conditions using booleans

Apply booleans to control the flow of a program using if, elif, and else.

🔹 Identify truthy and falsy values

Learn what Python considers “true” or “false” even when not strictly boolean.

🔹 Use booleans in realistic scenarios

Examples: access control, validations, game logic, inputs, simple decision systems, etc.

Exercise Difficulty Framework (Ranking System)
⭐ Rank 1 — Beginner

Very basic boolean expressions and simple comparisons.

⭐ Rank 2 — Easy

Conditions using logical operators and multiple comparisons.

⭐ Rank 3 — Intermediate

Multi-step boolean logic inside functions or basic decision rules.

⭐ Rank 4 — Advanced

More realistic problems using validations, access logic, or small rule systems.

⭐ Rank 5 — Professional

Clean, production-like decision utilities that rely heavily on boolean reasoning.
Recommended Study Workflow

Start with Boolean_Notes.py to understand the concepts and see simple examples.

Experiment inside Boolean_Examples.py, changing values and observing the results.

Work carefully through Boolean_Tasks.py — without looking at the answers.

After finishing, open Boolean_Tasks_Solutions.py and compare:

Is my logic correct?

How can I write more professional boolean expressions?

What patterns can I reuse in future modules?

Once I feel comfortable with booleans, I can move smoothly into more complex data types and combine them with conditions, loops, and functions to build smarter, more dynamic Python programs.
