Module 46 — id() Values

Author: Peyman Miyandashti
Year: 2025

In this module, I learn how id() values work in Python.

The id() function returns the identity of an object.
This identity is unique during the object’s lifetime and is commonly related to the object’s memory address (implementation detail).

Understanding id() helps me:

understand object identity vs equality

reason about mutability and immutability

debug reference-related issues

read professional and low-level Python code

better understand Python’s memory model

By the end of this module, I should feel comfortable:

Knowing what id() represents

Comparing identity (is) vs equality (==)

Understanding object reuse and caching

Observing how mutable and immutable objects behave

Using id() for debugging and learning, not logic

This module deepens my understanding of how Python manages objects.

Key Learning Objectives

By completing this module, I will be able to:

Explain what id() returns

Distinguish identity from value equality

Use is correctly

Understand why immutable objects behave differently

Avoid incorrect assumptions about memory

Module File Structure

ID_Values_Notes.py
Concepts, explanations, identity, and best practices.

ID_Values_Examples.py
Clear and practical examples.

ID_Values_Tasks.py

Exercise Difficulty Framework (Ranking System)

Rank 1 — Beginner
Basic use of id().

Rank 2 — Easy
Identity vs equality.

Rank 3 — Intermediate
Immutable vs mutable objects.

Rank 4 — Advanced
Object reuse and references.

Rank 5 — Professional
Debugging and reasoning about identity.

Recommended Study Workflow

Start with ID_Values_Notes.py to understand object identity clearly.
Run and modify ID_Values_Examples.py to observe behavior.
Complete ID_Values_Tasks.py before checking solutions.
Review ID_Values_Tasks_Solutions.py to adopt correct mental models.

id() explains where an object is, not what it is.
