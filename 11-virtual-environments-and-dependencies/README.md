Module 11 — Virtual Environments & Dependencies

This module explains how Python projects manage their own isolated environments and how dependencies are installed and controlled.
Virtual environments are a core part of real-world development because they allow every project to use its own versions of Python libraries without interfering with other projects on your system.

By the end of this module, I will understand how to create, activate, and use virtual environments, how to install and remove packages, and how to keep track of project dependencies in a clean, reliable way.

Key Learning Objectives

In this module, I will learn how to:

Understand why virtual environments are necessary in modern Python development.

Create and activate virtual environments using the built-in venv module.

Install, upgrade, and remove packages with pip.

Freeze dependencies into a requirements.txt file.

Re-create a full environment from an existing requirements file.

Follow best practices for keeping projects organized and reproducible.

Module File Structure

This module contains the following files:

VirtualEnv_Notes.py
Detailed explanations and commented examples on creating virtual environments, managing packages, and handling dependencies.

VirtualEnv_Examples.py
Small, focused examples that demonstrate typical workflows used by developers.

VirtualEnv_Tasks.py
Exercises designed to practice environment creation, package installation, and dependency management.

VirtualEnv_Tasks_Solutions.py
Clean, professional reference solutions.
(Should only be checked after attempting the tasks independently.)

What This Module Covers

What a virtual environment is and why it matters.

How to create isolated environments for different projects.

Commands for activating and deactivating environments on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
