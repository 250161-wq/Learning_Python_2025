Module 16 — Python Modules

Python modules allow us to organize code into reusable, maintainable, and professional structures.
A module is simply a Python file (.py) that can be imported into another script.

Understanding modules is essential for writing real-world applications, separating logic, avoiding repetition, improving readability, and sharing code across projects.

This module explains how modules work, how to import them, and how to build your own.

What I Will Learn in This Module

By completing this module, I will be able to:

Understand what a Python module is

Create my own modules and import them correctly

Use different import styles:

import module

from module import name

from module import *

import module as alias

Understand module search paths and how Python finds modules

Explore built-in modules such as math, random, and datetime

Use __name__ == "__main__" to control execution

Organize code into meaningful, reusable Python files

Avoid circular imports and other common pitfalls

Module File Structure

Recommended Study Workflow

Read Modules_Notes.py to understand how modules work.

Run Modules_Examples.py to see real imports in action.

Practice creating and importing your own modules in Modules_Tasks.py.

Compare with Modules_Tasks_Solutions.py after trying the tasks yourself.

Apply modules in future projects to build cleaner, larger programs.

After This Module

You’ll be ready to explore packages, library design, and advanced modular code structures — preparing you for larger-scale software development.
