Module 15 — Numeric Variants: Complex Numbers

Python includes built-in support for complex numbers — numeric values that contain a real part and an imaginary part.
Complex numbers are essential in mathematics, engineering, physics, signal processing, simulations, and many advanced algorithms.

This module introduces how complex numbers work in Python, how to create them, how to access their components, and how to perform arithmetic and mathematical operations with them.

What I Will Learn in This Module

By completing this module, I will be able to:

Understand how Python represents complex numbers (a + bj)

Create complex numbers using literals and constructors

Access .real and .imag components

Perform arithmetic with complex numbers:

addition

subtraction

multiplication

division

Use built-in functions such as abs(), complex(), and cmath utilities

Understand when complex numbers are the correct choice for a problem

Recognize real-world situations where complex numbers are used (engineering, waves, rotations, fractals, etc.)

Module File Structure

Complex_Notes.py
Clear explanations of complex number behavior, syntax, examples, and best practices.

Complex_Examples.py
Practical demonstrations of arithmetic, magnitude, phase, conversions, and real-world patterns.

Complex_Tasks.py
A set of exercises to practice creation, arithmetic, decomposition, and mathematical operations.

Complex_Tasks_Solutions.py
Clean reference solutions for all tasks (open only after attempting them).

Difficulty Levels in This Module

Rank 1 — Beginner
Basic creation and reading of complex numbers.

Rank 2 — Easy
Simple arithmetic: addition, subtraction, magnitude.

Rank 3 — Intermediate
Multiplication, division, conjugates, and type conversion.

Rank 4 — Advanced
Using the cmath library: polar coordinates, exponentials, phases.

Rank 5 — Professional
Realistic applications:

rotations using complex multiplication

fractal iteration

signal transformations

engineering-style calculations

Recommended Study Workflow

Start with explanations from Complex_Notes.py.

Run the demonstrations inside Complex_Examples.py.

Work through the exercises in Complex_Tasks.py.

Compare your work with Complex_Tasks_Solutions.py only after you try them first.

Apply these concepts in future modules dealing with math-heavy operations.

After This Module

The next modules will lean deeper into numeric systems, math libraries, data representation, and performance — all of which connect beautifully to complex numbers.
