Module 49 — Error Handling & Custom Exceptions

Author: Peyman Miyandashti
Year: 2025

In this module, I learn professional error handling in Python and how to design custom exception classes.

Errors are not failures — they are expected situations that must be handled clearly and intentionally.
Well-designed exceptions make code safer, easier to debug, and easier to maintain.

In this module, I move beyond basic try/except and learn how to:

design meaningful exception hierarchies

raise errors intentionally

propagate and wrap exceptions

communicate failure clearly

write defensive, production-ready code

By the end of this module, I should feel comfortable:

deciding when to catch errors

deciding when to raise errors

creating domain-specific exceptions

writing readable and predictable error handling

understanding professional error-handling patterns

This module is essential for real-world Python development.

Key Learning Objectives

By completing this module, I will be able to:

Explain the philosophy of error handling

Use try / except / else / finally correctly

Raise built-in exceptions intentionally

Create and use custom exception classes

Chain exceptions using raise ... from ...

Avoid common anti-patterns

Recommended Study Workflow

Start with Error_Handling_Notes.py to understand why errors are handled a certain way.
Run and modify Error_Handling_Examples.py to observe patterns.
