Module 41 — Properties

Author: Peyman Miyandashti
Year: 2025

In this module, I learn how properties work in Python.

Properties allow me to control access to attributes while keeping a clean and simple interface.
They let me read, validate, compute, or protect values as if they were normal attributes, without exposing internal implementation details.

Properties are essential for writing safe, maintainable, and professional object-oriented code.

They are commonly used for:

validation of attribute values

computed attributes

protecting internal state

refactoring without breaking public APIs

enforcing invariants

By the end of this module, I should feel comfortable:

Understanding what a property is

Using @property, @<name>.setter, and @<name>.deleter

Knowing when to use properties instead of public attributes

Writing clean, safe attribute access logic

Designing classes with controlled state

This module is a major step toward robust class design.

Key Learning Objectives

By completing this module, I will be able to:

Explain why properties exist

Create read-only and writable properties

Validate data using setters

Compute values dynamically

Refactor attributes safely

Write professional encapsulated classes

Exercise Difficulty Framework (Ranking System)

Rank 1 — Beginner
Basic read-only properties.

Rank 2 — Easy
Properties with setters.

Rank 3 — Intermediate
Validation and computed properties.

Rank 4 — Advanced
Refactoring attributes with properties.

Recommended Study Workflow

Start with Properties_Notes.py to understand the concept clearly.
Run and modify Properties_Examples.py to observe behavior.
Complete Properties_Tasks.py before checking solutions.
Review Properties_Tasks_Solutions.py to adopt clean patterns.

Properties allow internal flexibility without breaking external code.
